# piggame
Pig-game I made. Pig game is a dice rolling game were the objective is to hit 110 before the other player does. Each player takes turns and can roll as much as they want for that round. Once you roll a one your turn is over and you lose your score. You can hold your score at anytime so you don't lose it. This game was made with HTML/CSS/JAVASCRIPT. This game was made to practice using DOM.
